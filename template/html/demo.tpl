<h1>WARGuilds <?PHP echo WAR_VERSION; ?> Demo!</h1>
<p>The WARGuilds demo is intended to give a general idea of what WARGuilds can offer. WARGuilds assumes:</p>
<ol>
<li>You have little or no PHP experience</li>
<li>You can easily install and customize phpBB (required)</li>
<li>Average experience with HTML/CSS</li>
<li>You have your own domain - www.guildname.com</li>
<li>Your webserver has PHP 4.x+ and MySQL 4.x+ <br /><span class="small">(There <strong>is</strong> PHP5/MySQL5 support).</span></li>
<li>You're moderately familiar with FTP, uploading files, and directory structures.</li>
<li>You're willing and able to spend a minimal amount of time configuring various files to make the installation work correctly.</li>
</ol>
<p>We did our best to make this as simple as possible, but in adding some additional features, and making the project CSS2 / XHTML 1.0 valid,
there are some complications we had to include that you'll have to spend some time reading through and understanding if you want to customize them
for yourself.</p>
<p>There are of course the user forums available if you're unwilling or unable to figure out some of the more complex features.</p>
