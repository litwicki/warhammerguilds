<h2>The Beginning</h2>
<p>Sacrifice was formed during the summer of 2002 in the game <i>Dark Age of Camelot</i> by <b>Thezdin Bloodhaze</b>. The guild has rapidly grown in size and prestige since then. We are not without incidents of betrayal and distrust, but thrive on comradery and striving for excellence in whichever game we are currently active.</p>

<h2>Dark Age of Camelot (2002-2005)</h2>
<p>Dark Age of Camelot was released October 10, 2002. With its release came the revolution of online RPG PvP. Where previous games such as EverQuest, or even Ultima Online, focused almost exclusively on 1 on 1 combat, Dark Age of Camelot was centered around epic PvP battles ranging from small skirmishes, to gigantic realm-wide battles of thousands of players simultaneously.
<br /><br />
Sacrifice was formed on the basis of group combat. Where one group would be the focus, and success of the guild. As such, the guild maintained a very small base of membership. As the guild became more and more popular, its base of members grew substantially. Eventually growing to a point where a clash in ideals arose and the guild split in two. The child guild being named <i>Ataxia</i>. Ataxia lasted only a short while, and then fizzled out after weeks of dramatic, yet failed, attempts at proving their superiority. Sacrifice continued on and slowly rebuilt, gaining what would become life-long members.
<br /><br />
After over three years of PvP excellence, Sacrifice decided to move on to World of WarCraft and attempt to experience a more laid back atmosphere of PvE.</p>

<h2>World of WarCraft (2005-2007)</h2>
<p>Sacrifice began World of WarCraft with only 19 members, as our core of Dark Age of Camelot needn't be as large as what World of WarCraft would require. After months of recruitment and establishing the guild as a future raiding entity on our server, Sacrifice absorbed a guild into its ranks, as well as several other members of whom would become life-long members.
<br /><br />
After struggling to establish ourselves as a raiding powerhouse due to severe server lag, resulting in overpopulation of our server, Sacrifice transfered servers and saw immediate raiding success, accompanied with extreme malice from our rival guild. Only months after transfering, we had become the most successful guild on our server, but began to show severe signs of fatigue and apathy for the raiding environment Blizzard had created. Coupled with the extreme disloyalty and hatred several non-core members were beginning to display, Sacrifice removed several problem members and decided to exit World of WarCraft on top, and wait for the release of WAR!</p>

<h2>Warhammer Online (2007)</h2>
<p>Sacrifice anxiously awaits the possibility of entering the game in its beta stages to gain a strong foothold and further cement our roots as a powerful and successful PvP guild. If luck is not on our side, we will begin our dominance with the retail release of WAR in early 2008.</p>
